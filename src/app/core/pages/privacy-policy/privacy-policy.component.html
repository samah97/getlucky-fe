              <p>
                This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, disclose, and protect your personal information when
                you use our web app. By accessing or using our services, you acknowledge and consent to the terms
                outlined in this Privacy Policy.
              </p>
              <h5 class="pp-title">1. Personal Information Collection:</h5>
              <p>
                We collect your email for login, name and address for delivery, and date of birth to ensure compliance
                with legal age requirements.
              </p>
              <h5 class="pp-title">2. No Tracking and Non-Disclosure:</h5>
              <p>
                We do not track your device information, including current location, IP address and browsing activity,
                nor do we sell your information to third parties. We are committed to maintaining the confidentiality of
                your data. We do identify which country you're in based on the IP address, but this data is not logged.
              </p>
              <h5 class="pp-title">3. Usage Analytics:</h5>
              <p>
                We may collect information regarding your usage of the web app for analytical purposes. This information
                is used exclusively to enhance the user experience, identify areas for improvement, and optimize the
                functionality of our services.
              </p>
              <h5 class="pp-title">4. Data Retention:</h5>
              <p>
                While data may be kept indefinitely, you have the right to be forgotten. You can request the removal of
                all your data from our systems in compliance with GDPR.
              </p>
              <h5 class="pp-title">5. Payment Details:</h5>
              <p>Your payment details are securely stored using third-party service provider Stripe.</p>
              <h5 class="pp-title">6. Password Security:</h5>
              <p>
                Passwords are hashed, ensuring they cannot be viewed, even by our system administrators. We use TLS
                technology to secure data transmission between you and our servers.
              </p>
              <h5 class="pp-title">7. Security Disclaimer:</h5>
              <p>
                We employ robust security measures to ensure the secure storage of your data. However, it is important
                to note that no system is entirely immune to the risk of data breaches. While we take every reasonable
                precaution to safeguard your information, we cannot guarantee absolute security. Therefore, we are not
                liable for any data breach that may occur. We strongly advise you to use strong, unique passwords for
                your account and refrain from using the same password across different applications and services. Your
                cooperation in maintaining secure access to your account plays a crucial role in protecting your
                personal information.
              </p>
              <h5 class="pp-title">8. Winner Selection and Privacy:</h5>
              <p>
                Lottery winners are selected at random using robust algorithms to ensure fairness and prevent
                manipulation. Winner information will not be shared publicly. Winners will receive an email
                notification, and the item will be delivered to the provided address.
              </p>
              <h5 class="pp-title">9. Google or Facebook Cookies for OAuth Login:</h5>
