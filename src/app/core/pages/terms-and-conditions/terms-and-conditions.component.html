              <p>Welcome to Lucky. Before participating, please carefully read and understand the following terms and conditions:</p>

              <h3 class="pp-title">1. Eligibility</h3>
              <p>Our services are available only in specific countries. Users must be of the legal age of 18, 16, or 14, depending on the country of residence.</p>

              <h3 class="pp-title">2. Registration and Account Information</h3>
              <p>Users can sign up using their email and password or through Google OAuth. Accurate information is crucial for smooth delivery and compliance with laws.</p>

              <h3 class="pp-title">3. Bidding Process</h3>
              <p>The bidding fee is non-refundable under any circumstances. Once the bid is paid, it means the user will participate in the lottery, and no refunds will be issued. Placing more bids on one item increases your chances of winning it, but winning is not guaranteed as the draw is completely random.</p>

              <h3 class="pp-title">4. Lottery Draw</h3>
              <p>The draw is entirely automated and executed without any human intervention. Our system employs robust algorithms to ensure a completely unbiased selection process. In the event that the number of participants falls below a predetermined threshold, we reserve the right to postpone the lottery draw date. This decision aims to maintain the integrity of the lottery and provide participants with a fair chance of winning.</p>

              <h3 class="pp-title">5. Winner Notification and Claiming Prize</h3>
              <p>Winners will be notified via email. Winners must claim their prize within 2 weeks.</p>

              <h3 class="pp-title">6. Prize Delivery</h3>
              <p>Delivery is expected within a month after claiming the prize, but the timeframe depends on the delivery service providers. If the delivery cost exceeds 20 EUR or USD, the user may need to cover the remaining amount.</p>

              <h3 class="pp-title">7. Public Announcement</h3>
              <p>Winners will not be publicly announced to respect user privacy but will be contacted by email.</p>

              <h3 class="pp-title">8. Account Termination</h3>
              <p>We reserve the right to terminate accounts if non-compliant behavior is suspected. Data may be removed. Payments will not be refunded.</p>

              <h3 class="pp-title">9. Changes to Terms and Conditions</h3>
              <p>We reserve the right to update or modify these terms and conditions without notifying the user. We encourage you to review this page periodically.</p>

              <h3 class="pp-title">10. Governing Law</h3>
              <p>These terms are governed by the laws of [Specify Jurisdiction].</p> <!-- TODO -->
